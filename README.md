##Axis Coordinates
This program creates two int arrays from four pre-defined int values and performs various set theory checks (see directive) using an int value input by the user. 

#Directive
Define in your program four numbers of type int — a1, a2, b1, b2 — which we interpret
as coordinates on the number axis of end points of two intervals: A = [a1, a2] and
B = [b1, b2]. The program reads from the user one number (say, x) of type int and
prints true or false for each check.

Checks performed:
- X is an element of A
- X is an element of B
- X element of A, but not of B
- X element of B, but not of A
- X in the intersection of A and B
- X in the union of A and B
- X is not an element in both A and B

Do not use 'if' statements.
